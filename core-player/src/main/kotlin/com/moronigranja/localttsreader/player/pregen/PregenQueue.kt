/**
 * T5 pre-generation (decisions #35/#review): synthesizes the passages ahead of
 * the playhead while the current one plays, so a passage change is a [take]
 * fast path instead of a synthesize-then-play gap. In-memory, bounded by both
 * a passage count ([lookahead]) and a time target ([lookaheadSeconds]),
 * backed by [PcmPassageCache] as the post-v1 disk tier.
 *
 * The time target is what keeps playback gap-free: Kokoro synthesizes faster
 * than real-time (RTF 0.66-0.76 on the S22, hard-facts), so an always-running
 * generator fills `lookaheadSeconds` of audio ahead of the playhead and, once
 * filled, keeps up with 1x playback (each second of listening frees ~0.3 s of
 * synthesis slack). A jump forward prunes stale audio and refills from the new
 * position.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - [ensure] walks the [BookLayout] after [PlayerPosition] and synthesizes
 *   the missing passages up to both bounds. Single-flight: concurrent callers
 *   serialize on the internal lock; [take] runs lock-free against the map so
 *   the play loop never waits on synthesis.
 * - Every freshly synthesized passage is handed to [onSynthesized] so the owner
 *   can persist it to the disk tier (the service wires it to `PcmPassageCache`).
 * - Entries at/before the playhead are pruned on [ensure]; a jump forward
 *   prunes the now-stale look-ahead and refills.
 * - A failed synthesis stops the look-ahead: nothing is queued past the gap,
 *   and the player's synchronous synthesize path is the typed-failure
 *   fallback — never a placeholder.
