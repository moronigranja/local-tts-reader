 * passages already cached — so a run resumes anywhere (the cache is the
 * source of truth) and budgets keep the overnight job from hogging the
 * charger forever.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - Walks chapters 0..n and passages 0..m; every passage already on disk is
 *   skipped without synthesis.
 * - Stops when the budget is exhausted ([PregenBudget]), when the cache is
 *   saturated (free space below the last synthesized passage's size — a put
 *   would only evict another entry), when [shouldContinue] turns false (the
 *   caller yields to playback), or when the caller's coroutine is cancelled
 *   (checked per passage; the engine's synthesis is cancellable per batch).
 * - A failed synthesis is counted and the walk continues — the cache never
 *   holds a placeholder — but [consecutiveFailureCap] consecutive failures
 *   stop the run (an engine meltdown must not spin). `Unavailable` stops
 *   immediately: missing packs will not heal within the run.
 * - The returned [PregenProgress.terminal] names the stopping reason, so a
 *   caller (the WorkManager worker) can distinguish a safely bounded run
 *   from an engine failure instead of reporting every partial run as success
 *   (CR-1).
