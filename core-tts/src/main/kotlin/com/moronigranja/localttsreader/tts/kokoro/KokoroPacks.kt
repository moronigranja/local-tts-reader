/**
 * The pinned pack descriptors for Kokoro-82M — the first real descriptors in
 * the app (T2). Both point at thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx **model-files-v1.1**
 * release (the one the reference README uses), and the SHA-256s are of the
 * exact downloaded artifacts, produced by downloading each once during T2 —
 * verified against the upstream sizes below (never fabricated):
 *
 * - kokoro-model:  kokoro-v1.0.onnx  (325,505,369 B), fp32, en export,
 *   float speed input + duration output + embedded vocab — the canonical
 *   reference artifact. int8/fp16 variants and the v1.1-zh model exist but
 *   are not pinned: the V3 device pass picks the shipping precision.
 * - kokoro-voices: voices-v1.0.bin   (28,214,398 B), 54 voices across
 *   en-US/en-GB, fr, es, it, pt-BR, ja, zh, hi. German and Korean have no
 *   v1.0 voices, so the engine does not advertise them.
 *
 * A descriptor change (new artifact, re-export) is a version bump + re-pin:
 * download once, hash, commit.
