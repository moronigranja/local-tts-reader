/**
 * Splits a phoneme string into inference batches and reports the pause a
 * batch end should be followed by — a direct port of kokoro-onnx's `chunker`
 * (`_atoms` / `_pack` / `split_phonemes` / `pause_after`).
 *
 * The model context is fixed at [MAX_PHONEME_LENGTH] phonemes, so long inputs
 * are cut at the least disruptive boundary: sentence, clause, word, and only
 * as a last resort mid-word. Batches are then packed to fill evenly: a short
 * tail batch is spoken at a different rate and loudness than its neighbours,
 * so the smallest limit that needs no extra pass over the text is used.
