/**
 * Static voice metadata for the kokoro v1.0 voices pack (C1.3): the 54 names
 * are presentation data — the roster lives only inside the downloaded
 * `voices-v1.0.bin` ([KokoroVoiceBank]), so "choose a voice before download"
 * needs a static table. The roster below was read from the pinned pack
 * artifact itself (the pack is the contract; metadata is presentation):
 * `unzip -l voices-v1.0.bin` yields exactly these 54 `.npy` members, and this
 * table is cross-checked against a loaded pack in tests.
 *
 * Prefix families → language/gender, mirroring [KokoroEngine.VOICE_LANGUAGES]
 * (the espeak-ng phonemization map): af/am en-US, bf/bm en-GB, ef/em es,
 * ff/fm fr, if/im it, pf/pm pt-BR, jf/jm ja, zf/zm zh, hf/hm hi. v1.0 has no
 * `fm_` voices — only `ff_siwis` — so the table carries the families the pack
 * actually ships.
