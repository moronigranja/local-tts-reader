/**
 * A downloadable engine asset: model weights, a per-language asset, or a voice.
 *
 * Packs are **never bundled in the APK** (hard-facts: "language/voice packs are
 * downloadable, never bundled"): every asset is a runtime, explicit,
 * user-consented, resumable download, verified against [sha256Hex] and cached
 * under the pack cache root once verified (decision #7).
 *
 * Descriptors are data: an engine impl declares the packs it needs, and the
 * [PackRegistry] tracks their state. A descriptor must be fully pinned — the
 * URL and the SHA-256 of the exact artifact — before it can be shipped;
 * descriptors are never shipped with placeholder hashes (T1 decision: hashes
 * are produced by downloading the artifact once during the engine slice, T2).
 *
 * [id] must be globally unique across engines (registry key); the convention is
 * `<engineId>-<name>` (e.g. `kokoro-model`, `cosyvoice3-model`).
