# Conventions

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Kotlin (JVM). No Java in new code.
- **Build:** Gradle Kotlin DSL. Version catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`).
- **Kotlin:** K2 compiler, `-Xjsr305=strict`, coroutines + `kotlin-flow`.
- **JVM target:** 17+. **minSdk 26** (needed for ONNX Runtime Mobile; document why).
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Repository, unidirectional-ish data flow.
  - UI observes `StateFlow`; user intents go one way in.
  - Business logic in `ViewModel`/`StateHolder`; keep it testable and UI-agnostic.
- **Concurrency:** Coroutines on `Dispatchers.IO` for file/model I/O,
  `Main` for UI. Cancellations matter (long TTS queues, file scans) — propagate them.
- **DI:** Hilt (or a minimal hand-rolled graph if keeping deps tiny — decide early,
  keep it consistent everywhere).
- **Persistence:** Room for the library index, reading progress, settings, and cached
  parsed content pointers. Never re-parse a book on every launch.
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose + Material 3. Keep composition functions pure; hoist state.
- **Audio:** Foreground playback service. Use a dedicated audio playback path with
  `AudioManager`/`AudioAttributes` (PLAYBACK_MEDIA), ducking/interruption handling,
  and MediaSession so lock-screen/Bluetooth controls work.
- **Naming:** camelCase code, snake_case resources/DB columns, PascalCase types,
  UPPER_SNAKE for constants. Resource IDs and package segments lowercase.

## Do and don't

**Do**
- Design against the abstractions in [modules.md](modules.md) (`EBook`, `TTSEngine`,
  `LibraryStore`), not concrete formats/models. New formats become another implementor,
  not new call sites.
- Keep the model download and file I/O off the main thread and cancellable.
- Persist reading progress and per-book settings; restoring where the user was is core.
- Respect Android storage/permissions norms; use SAF (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`) for
  opening user files, scoped storage, and a foreground service notification for playback.
- When the spec is unclear, choose the conservative, reversible option and say why.

**Don't**
- Don't add network/cloud/account features without an explicit reason in
  [hard-facts.md](hard-facts.md).
- Don't automate or hide DRM removal. Don't ship keys, key-derivation, or DRM tools.
- Don't scrape the Kindle app on-device for reading progress — use the official export
  API or a manual resume point instead.
- Don't bundle TTS model weights or language/voice packs in the APK; download them once
  (explicit, resumable), cache, allow re-download.
- Don't ship a bare `android.TextToSpeech` system-TTS wrapper as the engine — the point
  is the open-weight on-device model. System TTS is acceptable only as a documented
  degraded fallback behind the same interface.
- Don't introduce a second convention (folder, pattern, DI style) when one already
  exists elsewhere. Match the nearest existing pattern.
- Don't leave dead parsers, dead engines, or half-migrated callers. Clean cutover.

## Definition of done for a change

- Behavior covered by a test that fails without the change.
- No silent fallbacks that mask failure (missing language, corrupt file → clear state).
- No new blocking permissions or dependencies without noting the tradeoff.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck` and `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` green.
- The relevant doc(s) updated if a convention or fact changed.
