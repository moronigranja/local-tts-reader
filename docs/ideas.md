# Ideas & candidate features

A candidate pool, not a commitment: each row records what the feature is, where it
came from, why it fits this app, and which roadmap slice would host it. A feature
graduates to the roadmap (and the decision log) only when it is decided on.
Brand identity (name/tagline/icon) lives in [docs/brand.md](brand.md); engine
candidate research (Supertonic 3, Piper) moved to
[docs/landscape.md](landscape.md) §Second-engine candidates (2026-08-26).

## Candidates

| Idea | Source | Why it fits | Home | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accelerator delegates for TTS (GPU/NPU) + power-efficiency run | Audiobookify: TTS "on the GPU and CPU (neural engine)", pitched on battery/thermals | Extends decision #21 directly: the CPU-only gate failed for CosyVoice3, but small Kokoro-class models may gain from ORT NNAPI/GPU delegates. Nothing is decided until measured (RTF + power on the reference device) | T2/T3 follow-up (`core-tts` research; re-run of the `spike-tts` harness pattern) | Flow-DiT-class models showed no credible mobile acceleration path (decision #21) — do not assume; measure. Audiobookify does run Kokoro on the iPhone neural engine (in-app demo prints) — same direction, Android still unmeasured |
| Android system TTS fallback tier — plan B (2026-08-27) | user review | Weak devices (Bigme-class) cannot afford the 325 MB Kokoro cold open (~25–58 s first audio, ~834 MB PSS); the platform TTS is already SoC-optimized and needs no packs. Opt-in only: system engines may be cloud-backed (decision #7 ethos) | Phase D plan B (feature-player): `AndroidTtsEngine : TTSEngine` emitting `SynthesisOutcome.Audio(segments = null)` (read-along degrades by the existing CosyVoice3 contract), router behind `KokoroRuntime.engine()`, 24 kHz resample, `"system-tts:<locale>"` cache key | Not now — D2 accelerator research is the primary path; costed ~1–2 sessions (adapter + router + host tests, device-only verification); revisit if D2 gates fail or first-audio targets stay unmet |
| Reading–listening progress sync (read-along) | Audiobookify: "progress tracks well between reading manually and listening" | The `progress` table (P1) already stores one resume passage per book; reader and player both write it | T4 + feature-reader | One source of truth: the `progress` row per book; keep chapter+passage semantics identical in both surfaces |
| TXT + Markdown import | Audiobookify formats: EPUB, MD, TXT only; PDF explicitly deferred | Cheap: plain text/Markdown flows straight through `BookSegmentation`; needs a small text `EBookParser` (MD headings → chapters) + SAF filter entry | C-lane quick win | PDF stays deferred — both apps agree |
| Android Auto media controls | Audiobookify comment: CarPlay shows working media controls via MediaSession | Conventions already mandate MediaSession (T4); Auto uses the same session, no extra architecture | T4 | Verify on device once the player exists |
| "Listen from here" (resume/play from any passage) | Audiobookify UX feedback: only chapter-start was reachable | S3 resume wiring already targets the passage grain; expose it as a reader gesture | S3 / feature-reader | Gesture choice: long-press a passage → "Listen from here" |
| Playback position preserved across speed changes | Audiobookify bug report: changing speed reset the play point | Player correctness requirement (passage + intra-passage offset must survive settings changes) | T4 | Explicit regression test |
| Playback robustness on output/hardware switch | Audiobookify bug report: playback stopped when CarPlay took over and on headphone resume | Audio focus/ducking + route-change handling; part of the conventions' audio contract | T4 | In the focus/ducking acceptance criteria |
| RSVP speed-reading (one word at a time) | Audiobookify commenter idea (OP: "added to my list") | Distinct from TTS; a reading-mode nicety | feature-reader (future) | Low priority; no dependency on TTS — shipped in the Audiobookify build (in-app demo prints): word-at-a-time, w/s speed, % position |
| Light/dark theme following system | Audiobookify commenter request | Compose Material 3 day/night; app is pre-1.0 so theming is not yet set | V-lane / UI polish | Trivial once the theme exists |
| Public-domain classics bundle (heard.quest ships 50+) | heard.quest | Fits the offline-free ethos only as downloadable packs (decision #7: never bundled); it is a content store, not a reader feature | Out of scope for v1 | Note-only; revisit if a "sample library" is ever wanted |
| Docked player with sentence-sync read-along | Audiobookify in-app demo (prints 2–5): reading page with the playback panel docked to it; narration highlights the current sentence as it speaks ("follow each sentence as the story moves"); "CC" surfaces the sentence text | The app's core loop — "import, open the page, tap Listen"; reader and player become one UI slice, not two; progress stays single-sourced (the `progress` row per book) | T4 + feature-reader | Sentence view and RSVP share one text renderer; the same print's onboarding copy states the product thesis in one sentence |
| TODAY stats dashboard (read vs. listened, streak) | Audiobookify home (print 1): "29m" today, weekly Read 7m / Listened 21m chart, 14-day streak, Analytics > | Fits the dual-surface design — read/listen split is native and measures both consumption modes | V-lane / UI polish; new slice (local stats table), not in roadmap | All on-device, so offline-first holds; needs per-day read/listened minutes (not in the P1 schema), a home restructure, and day-granularity streak logic |
| Saved speed presets | Audiobookify speed popover (print 3): "Hold a shortcut to save the current speed" | Speed changes already must preserve the play point (logged bug → T4 regression); presets are the same surface | T4 | No schema; global presets first, per-book override later |
| Sleep timer incl. end-of-chapter | Audiobookify sleep-timer menu (print 4): 5m–1h, End of chapter, Off | Chapter boundaries already exist in the domain model — end-of-chapter stop is nearly free; the player needs a stop condition anyway | T4 | Session-local timer, no schema; end-of-chapter = stop at the next boundary |
| Sync from Kindle (official export / Highlights-Reports API) | hard-facts "Legitimate sync sources" — Amazon returning the user's own data: the "Your Content and Documents"/"Download your data" export (reading position, last-read, highlights) and the read-only Highlights/Reports API (access-token, cursor pagination) | Manual resume (S3/T4) covers v1 without Amazon access; this automates position import from the user's own data, on-demand | Post-v1 slice (V-lane / new `core-sync`), not in roadmap | On-demand/scheduled only, never real-time; both paths are official read-only. The undocumented, rate-limited "Manage Your Contents and Documents" endpoint (DRM-free lending-eligible titles only) stays a possible future bridge, not a foundation (hard-facts) |
| Per-fiction playback speed (auto-restore) | candela: speed dialed into one book restores on reopen | Progress is already per-book; a per-book settings key rides the same surface | T4 | Global preset + per-book override |
| Voice library with favorites and tiers | candela Voice Library: engine-grouped, starred voices, quality tiers | V1 settings needs a voice picker anyway; stars/tiers are settings keys, no schema | V1 | Tiers map to pack sizes (Piper low/med/high ~14–28 MB) |
| Auto language detection → voice routing | candela: mid-chapter language switch routes text to a matching voice | Multilingual books (en + fr/es dialogue) are common; detection opt-in | T5 / post-v1 | Needs detection + per-language voice mapping; post-v1 size |
| Multi-engine parallel synthesis tuning | candela: 1–8 engine instances, per-engine thread pools, producer on an audio-priority thread | T5 pre-generation must fit the device's RTF; these are the levers | T5 (design reference — decisions #25) | Validate on S22 Ultra first; candela's Performance-modes wiki is the reference |
| Real-time translation to pt-BR (read EN books aloud in PT) | owner (2026-08-25; feasibility + complexity reviewed) | Kokoro v1.0 already ships pt-BR voices (voices-v1.0.bin); ONNX Runtime already in the stack; a `TTSEngine` decorator adds the stage without touching player/pipeline contracts | T5 + new `core-translate` (post-v1 slice) | NMT en→pt int8 (~30–80 MB; OPUS-MT CC-BY-4.0 — attribution; NLLB-600M CC-BY-NC — avoid). "Real-time" = hidden behind the pre-gen queue, not simultaneous interpretation. Translation failure degrades to the original text; index/matching unaffected (output-side only) |
| Offline chapter pre-generation (manual "generate X chapters" + scheduled overnight while charging) | owner (2026-08-25) | Shifts synthesis cost off the go — listening becomes pure AudioTrack playback; makes the CosyVoice3 fallback tier viable despite the #21 RTF gate (overnight ≈3 ch/night at RTF 16; whole-book for Kokoro); composes with the translation decorator (translate + generate while charging) | T5 extension + `core-tts` job core; WorkManager adapter + per-book toggle in V1 | PCM ≈170 MB/h (24 kHz 16-bit mono — `SAMPLE_RATE` 24_000 × 2 B/s); cache key = engine+voice+speed+translation config (settings change ⇒ re-generate); LRU eviction under a disk budget; charging-gated via WorkManager constraints; skip generation while actively playing; candela's PCM chapter cache validates the cache side |
| App export/backup + restore (read positions, library index, settings, optionally the book files) | owner (2026-08-25, review follow-up) | Data-portability fits the offline-first/no-account ethos; content-hash book ids make restore idempotent (re-import → same bookId → progress reattaches); the launch-time rebuild means the index comes back from the cached parses | Post-v1 V-lane / new small `core-backup` slice (decisions #29) | Versioned zip via SAF: settings/library/progress JSON + `books/` optional; cached parses ride along to honor "never re-parse"; TTS pack cache re-downloads, stays out; DRM-free only (encrypted files already rejected); restore = import flow + row merge, idempotent by hash |
| User bookmarks (explicit anchors, distinct from auto-progress) | owner (2026-08-25, review follow-up) | Auto `progress` is one resume row per book; bookmarks are user-set anchors — standard in audiobook readers and cheap | T4 reader+player slice (decisions #29) | Room migration v2 `bookmarks` (bookId, chapter, passage, offset, createdAt); long-press passage → add; list/delete in a reader menu; rides along in the export archive |
| Read log: per-book position history + undo-skip; full session log post-v1 | owner (2026-08-25, review follow-up) | Accidental play/skips need an undo path, not confirm dialogs; the session log doubles as the stats dashboard's data source | T4 (ring + undo) + post-v1 full log (decisions #29) | `position_history` table (capped rows/book) written by the player; undo-skip = one tap back to the previous position; full session timeline post-v1 feeds TODAY stats |
| Folder import via SAF tree (scan a whole folder, not just picked files) | owner (2026-08-25, import review) | The picker is multi-select only (`OpenMultipleDocuments`); a tree grant (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`) + `DocumentFile` walk with the supported-extension filter feeds the same `BookImporter.importAll` batch — parsers/segmentation untouched, per-file failure isolation already exists | C-lane quick win (feature-library), post-C7 | Persistable tree grant covers re-reads after restart; decide recursion depth (root + one level?) and a per-batch file cap; C7's text-parser SAF entry is the same picker surface |
| Pre-generate space estimate (size preview before enqueuing) | owner (2026-08-26) | Pre-generation is shipped (decisions #42); the library-row "Pre-generate" action already foregrounds a progress job, and the expected footprint is computable before synthesis — bytes = 24_000 × 2 × estimated duration — so the confirm step can state it | T5 extension (`PregenWorker` surface) | Estimate from segmented text length (chars → speaking time at the active voice/speed), not by synthesizing; exact for chapters already cached (bytes on disk, cache-keyed per `PregenKey`) |
| Per-book audio usage in settings + delete generated audio | owner (2026-08-26) | The PCM disk tier is real storage now; settings (V1, decisions #36) is the natural home for the per-book breakdown + total, and every cached chapter is re-generable on demand — delete is a safe operation | T5 extension + V-lane settings surface | Mirror the delete on the library row next to "Pre-generate" (per-book context menu); never evict passages queued or currently playing (fast-path invariant); cache-keyed (engine+voice+speed), so a settings change invalidates naturally |
| Auto-delete read passages | owner (2026-08-26) | Listened passages behind the resume point are dead weight for the disk budget the LRU already enforces | T5 extension | "Read" must be defined against the `position_history` ring (T4): evict only what is behind the resume point and outside the undo ring's reach, so undo-skip keeps working |
| "Smart" pre-generation from reading habits | owner (2026-08-26) | Manual + overnight pre-gen ships (decisions #42); the `position_history` ring and the post-v1 session log already record habits — predict the next chapters (and next book) and queue them inside the same overnight window | T5 extension, post-v1 marker (needs the session-log slice) | Prediction only sizes the same budget/saturation stops — never overrides them; signals: active book's next chapters, per-book listening velocity, day-of-week patterns; opt-in |
| Long-press paragraph menu — "Play from here" + "Copy text" | owner (2026-08-27) | Middle-tap play-at-passage already ships (#38; the long-press gesture was rejected then as less discoverable — a menu is the discoverable superset); copy is nearly free: the passage text is already in `PlaybackUiState.passageText`, and tapped-line→passage mapping exists (`passageStartLines`/`indexOfLast`) | feature-reader (small slice; #38 deviation note) | Copy = `ClipboardManager` on the passage string, no schema; menu must not fight the middle-tap play (long-press vs tap discrimination: `detectTapGestures(onLongPress)`); optionally extend to chapter-level copy ("Copy chapter") once the context menu exists |
| Storage-folder grant ("keep data across reinstalls", /sdcard/Mihon pattern) | owner (2026-08-27); mechanism verified against Mihon's `/sdcard/Mihon` — an SAF tree grant (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`), not a raw-path write: the folder + contents persist across uninstalls, the URI grant is re-requested on first run of the new install | Real "survive reinstall" for generated data needs a user-granted folder; fits the offline-first ethos and composes with backup (the folder IS the archive root). Holds for file-stores only — pregen PCM cache, optional original book files, covers — NOT the Room DB (bookmarks/progress stay internal; SQLite under a user-granted raw folder is fine but the OS can evict/clean it and grant baskets are a thing) | Post-v1; sibling/extension of the `core-backup` slice (decisions #29), supersedes the "app folder on /sdcard" reading | SAF tree grant root `Ayvu/`; move `PregenCache`/`CoverStore` roots to `grantedRoot/Ayvu/{pregen,covers}`; one-time legacy→external migration on first run with a grant; DB exported into the folder by the backup slice, re-attached idempotently by content-hash |
## Validated, no action

- **DRM-free stance + AZW3**: Audiobookify refuses DRM and defers AZW3; we already
  parse DRM-free `.azw3`/`.kf8` and refuse encrypted files (hard-facts #15). Our
  choice is confirmed by a sibling product.
- **Tiny app, models fetched in-app**: matches decision #7 (downloadable packs,
  nothing bundled). Confirmed direction.
- **Free, no account**: matches our offline-first/no-cloud ethos (hard-facts).
- **Voice packs: flat single-file downloads, fp32 weights** — candela regressed
  INT8→fp32 (vocoder fuzz, Samsung-tablet reports) and pre-extracts tarballs
  server-side; adopted as decisions #26.
- **In-process native TTS engine on Android** — candela ships sherpa-onnx in-process
  down to low-end chips; our architecture/conventions assume the same; the raw
  kokoro-onnx port (T2, decisions #25) re-confirms on our hardware at the V3 pass.
- **System TTS as degraded fallback** — candela ships zero-download System TTS;
  matches conventions ("documented degraded fallback"); no feature work.

## Risk note (not a feature)

- **Background TTS can be taken away by OS policy**: iOS 27 beta removed background
  neural-engine access for third-party apps. Android analog: OEM background
  restrictions / Doze could kill long-running foreground playback — the player must
  use a proper foreground service and handle being re-killed gracefully (T4).

## Decision status (decisions #29 snapshot 2026-08-25; updated 2026-08-27)

| Idea | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Docked player + sentence-sync read-along | **In v1 — the player UX** (T4 reshaped; uses T2 timings) |
| TXT + Markdown import | **In v1 — C7** |
| Read-along progress sync, Android Auto, Listen-from-here, speed preserves position, output-switch robustness, speed presets, sleep timer, per-book speed restore | Folded into T4/S3 acceptance criteria |
| User bookmarks (explicit anchors) | Folded into T4 (v1) — migration v2 table + reader gesture |
| Read log: per-book position ring + undo-skip | Folded into T4 (v1); full session log = post-v1 marker (feeds TODAY stats) |
| Theme-follows-system; voice picker + favorites | Theme folded into V1; Settings voice picker/favorites shipped; guided first-run + primary-listening selector scheduled as roadmap C2 (decisions #59) |
| Offline chapter pre-generation | **Shipped** (2026-08-26, decisions #42) |
| pt-BR translation decorator | Post-v1 — new `core-translate` marker |
| App export/backup + restore (positions, library, settings, optional books) | Post-v1 — new `core-backup` slice marker |
| Kindle export/highlights sync | Post-v1 (already deferred by decision) |
| RSVP, classics bundle, auto language detection | Stays in the pool (no v1 dependency) |
| Pre-gen space estimate + per-book audio usage/delete | **Decided** (2026-08-27, decisions #44) — post-v1 roadmap, follow-ups to shipped pre-gen |
| Accelerator/quantization/power research | **Promoted — roadmap D2** (decisions #57): measured Kokoro delegate/quantization gate on S22 + HiBreak; no production change without a quality-preserving win |
| Folder import via SAF tree | **Promoted — roadmap F3** (decisions #57), paired with visible import progress/cancellation |
| TTS pronunciation replacements | **Promoted — roadmap G1** (decisions #57); the reported `Ms.` defect is the first general normalization regression |
| Long-press paragraph menu — Play from here + Copy text | **Promoted — roadmap G2** (decisions #57) |
| Hardware/listening gestures | **Promoted — roadmap G3** (decisions #57): narrow MediaSession + opt-in visible-reader volume-key scope; configurable tap-zone editor remains pooled |
| Auto-delete read passages, habit-driven pre-gen, translate language coverage | Stays in the pool |

## Ereader feature comparison (2026-08-27, user review item 7)

Feature survey of Kindle (Android), KOReader, and Librera to mine missing
Ayvu features. Full 42-row sourced table lives in the 2026-08-27 review
session (agent `EreaderComparison-2`); the ranked takeaway:

| # | Idea | Where it exists today | Why it fits Ayvu |
|---|------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Word-level TTS highlight synced to audio position | Kindle (line), KOReader TTS plugin (word) | Sentence highlight is the base; pan word spans to each spoken word |
| 2 | Configurable tap zones + gestures incl. volume-key prev/next | Librera zone map, KOReader gesture manager | One-handed listening/reading; volume keys are the screen-off affordance |
| 3 | Progress & time-left indicators (chapter/book at current speed) | Kindle, KOReader footer | Single most-requested orientation aid Ayvu still lacks |
| 4 | TTS pronunciation replacements (regex + ttsPAUSE/SKIP/NEXT) | Librera TTS Replacements | Fixes names/abbreviations + skips page furniture |
| 5 | Auto page/flip scroll synchronized with playback | KOReader flipping, Librera auto-scroll | Keeps read-along text ahead of the cursor |
| 6 | Skim widget / book-map timeline (chapter marks, % jump) | KOReader | Non-linear navigation over long books |
| 7 | Reading statistics (time/page, calendar) | KOReader Statistics plugin | Rewards listening time; differentiates the library |
| 8 | RSVP speed-reading mode | Librera | Cheap distinctive complement to TTS skimming |
| 9 | Profiles / per-book defaults (day/night, listening vs reading) | Librera/KOReader, Kindle themes | One-tap mode switching, reset-safe |
| 10 | Library: progress badges, series/collections, recent-reads sort, play widget | Kindle/Librera | Makes the library a resume surface |
