/**
 * F4 external-file intake routing (roadmap F4): pure decisions for the two
 * intent entry points, shared by feature-library (ACTION_VIEW gateway +
 * forwarded book shares) and feature-share (ACTION_SEND triage). The
 * extension gate is the single source of truth — no second extension list
 * (F2/F3 pattern, [EBookFormats]). MIME mismatches are expected (file
 * managers type books inconsistently), so a supported extension always wins.
 *
 * - ACTION_VIEW: any file that reaches the gateway with a supported extension
 *   imports; kfx/DRM/unsupported get typed guidance, never a silent no-op.
 * - ACTION_SEND: a share is triaged — text/image shares keep the existing
 *   resolve path; book files (supported extension, or an ebook MIME with an
 *   unusable name) forward to the import gateway; kfx/DRM get guidance.
