/**
 * CR-3/A3: the single serialization point for index MUTATION — import
 * publish, delete removal, and the launch-time rebuild all reconcile under
 * this lock, so no stale snapshot can purge a book the Room store already
 * committed, and no durable write can land after its index entry was
 * removed. Room itself is written outside the lock (durable truth); the
 * derived index is only ever touched inside it.
 *
 * The lock is a plain coroutine [Mutex]; guards are reentrant-free, so a
 * caller must not hold it across another indexed operation.
