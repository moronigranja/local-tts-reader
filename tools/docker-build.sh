# Run a Gradle task inside the Android toolchain image.
#
# The SDK/NDK are baked into the image; Gradle/Maven caches live in named volumes, so
# rebuilds are fast and the workspace stays source-only. Built APKs land in the
# workspace (host-owned — fine for adb install).
#
# Runs as the invoking host user (uid/gid passed through via --user), so nothing the
# build writes into the mounted workspace or cache volumes is root-owned — host
# `./gradlew` runs are never blocked by stale root-owned files.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/docker-build.sh :core-locate:test     # JVM-only, fast
#   tools/docker-build.sh assembleDebug         # full APK
#   tools/docker-build.sh installDebug          # build + adb install to connected device
