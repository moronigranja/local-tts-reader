/**
 * F3: the recursion/cap policy for folder import, kept Android-free so the
 * hostile-input decisions (depth bound, per-batch cap, extension filter) are
 * host-testable. The `FolderScanner` DocumentFile adapter supplies the tree;
 * the pure [FolderScanPolicy.collect] decides what to keep.
 *
 * The two bounds are the first concrete resource-exhaustion controls of the
 * "hostile-input and resource limits" review (roadmap, decisions #96.8):
 *
 * - [MAX_DEPTH]: nested folder levels below the granted root that get scanned.
 *   A tree grant is typically library-shaped (a folder, or a folder of
 *   subfolders), so one level covers "books grouped by author/series" without
 *   an unbounded-recursion surface on an adversarial tree.
 * - [MAX_FILES]: defensive ceiling on files collected from one tree, so a
 *   drop-box folder cannot feed an unbounded batch.
