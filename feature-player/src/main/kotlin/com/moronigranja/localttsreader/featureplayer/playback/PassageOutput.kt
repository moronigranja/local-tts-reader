/**
 * One passage's audio output — the seam the service plays through and tests
 * fake. [play] is non-blocking; the CALLER detects completion either via an
 * exact end marker armed with [setCompletionMarker] (verified reliable on the
 * S22, decisions #81) or by polling [positionSamples] against the frame count
 * as a fallback (the historical "static markers unreliable on some devices"
 * concern — kept because the marker path is device-dependent); [stop] cancels
 * playback, after which [positionSamples] reads 0.
 *
 * [speed] is applied via [AudioTrack.setPlaybackRate] — the audio system's
 * rate converter (no manual resampling, no interpolation artifacts). The
 * buffer holds book-time frames, so [positionSamples] counts book-time
 * frames regardless of [speed] (a 2× track reaches the same frame count in
 * half the physical time — decisions #52).
